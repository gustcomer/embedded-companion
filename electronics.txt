Jack: a socket designed to receive a jack plug.
Levels of Abstraction: represent the level structure of a typical computer system
  - Level 1: Logic Gate Level -- combinational and sequential circuits.
  - Level 2: Microcode Level
  - Level 3: Instruction Set Architecture Level
  - Level 4: Operating System Level
  - Level 5: Assembly Level
  - Level 6: High-order language level -- languages like C.
  - Level 7: Application Level
Transistor: devices that can amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power.
  - Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) consists of three layers of semiconductor material (NPN or PNP).
  - Field-Effect Transistor (FET) can be of types Junction FET (JFET) and Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor FET (MOSFET).
