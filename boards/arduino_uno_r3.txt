ICSP: consists of 6 pins, MISO, SCK, MOSI, VCC, GND, RESET.
  MISO (Master In Slave Out): used for data transmission from the microcontroller to the programmer.
  MOSI (Master Out Slave In): used for data transmission from the programmer to the microcontroller.
  SCK (Serial Clock): provides the clock signal for synchronization between the programmer and the microcontroller.
