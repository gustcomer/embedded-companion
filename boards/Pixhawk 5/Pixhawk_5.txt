Microcontroller Unit (MCU):
  STM32F7 Series: A powerful ARM Cortex-M7 MCU that handles most of the flight control computations.
  for the v5X: STM32F765
Sensors:
  Accelerometer and Gyroscope: Typically an InvenSense MPU6000 or ICM-20689, used for measuring the vehicle's acceleration and angular velocity.
  Magnetometer: Usually a Honeywell HMC5883L or a Bosch BMM150, used for measuring the magnetic field to determine the heading.
  Barometer: Often a Bosch BMP280 or MS5611, used for measuring atmospheric pressure to determine altitude.
  Compass: Integrated within the magnetometer or as a separate component.
Memory:
  Flash Memory: Used for storing firmware and flight logs.
  RAM: Dynamic memory used by the MCU for flight operations.
Power Management:
  Power Distribution Board (PDB): Manages power distribution to various components.
  Battery Management System (BMS): Ensures safe charging and discharging of the battery.
Communication Interfaces:
  UART Ports: For communication with GPS, telemetry radios, and other peripherals.
  I2C Ports: For sensors and other I2C devices.
  CAN Bus: For robust communication with CAN-enabled devices.
  SPI Ports: For high-speed communication with certain sensors.
GPS Module:
  Integrated or external GPS module for providing location data.
Other Peripherals:
  SD Card Slot: For additional data logging.
  LED Indicators: For visual status indication.
  USB Port: For connecting to a ground control station for firmware updates and configuration.
RC Input/Output:
  PWM Outputs: For controlling motors and servos.
  RC Input: For receiving commands from the remote controller.
