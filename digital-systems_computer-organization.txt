Glossary

Adder: adds three binary digits being two significant bits A and B and one Carry In bit Cin. Produces a sum bit S and a Carry-Out bit Cout.
Adder/Subtracter: CI that allows for addition A+B and subtraction A-B as well.
  - the subtraction part is built using an Adder and the binary relatio  NEG x = 1 + NOT x.
  - for a four-bit ripple-carry Adder/Subtracter, it would have an input signal Sub to indicate wether this is an addition or subtraction operation, inputs A0 to A3 and B0 to B3,, result bits S0 to S3, a Carry Out bit Cout and an overflow bit V.
Binary Decoder: takes a binary number as input and sets one of several data output lines to 1 and the rest to 0.
  - a 2x4 binary decoder would take S0 and S1 as input and would activate one of the output signals D0 to D3.
  - it can be seen as a demultiplexer with input signal D=1.
Demultiplexer: routes a single input value to one of several output lines.
  - a four-output demultiplexer would have an input signal D, two selector signals S0 and S1, and four output signals D0 to D3.
Half Adder: just like a full adder, but does not take the Carry-In bit Cin ibto account. It produces the same sum bit S abd the Carry-out bit Cout.
  - it is perfect to be used as the first Adder in a chain of Adders to add multiple bits.
  - you can use a Half Adder to sum the LSB (least significat bit) or you can use a Full Adder with Cin set to zero.
Multiplexer: device that selects one of several data inputs to be routed to a single data output.
  - an eight-input multiplexer would have data input lines with inputs from D0 to D7, select control lines with signals S0 to S2 and a single data output line F.
NZVC bits: used to indicate the outcome of arithmetic and logic operations and crucial for branching or conditional execution of instructions.
  N - Negative Flag: set if the result of an operation is negative. Represents the sign bit.
  Z - Zero Flag: set if the result of an operation is zero.
  V - Overflow Flag: set if there is a signed overflow in an arithmetic operation.
  C - Carry Flag: set if there is an unsigned overflow in an arithmetic operation.
Ripple-Carry Adder: a digital adder constructed by cascading multipple adders in series to add binary numbers of arbitrary length.
  - the LSB (least significant bit) adder can be implemented using a Half-Adder or a Full-Adder with Cin set to zero.
  - for an n-bit ripple-carry adder the total delay is approximately n times the delay of a single full adder.
XOR: exclusive OR. Its output is 1 when the number of inputs is odd. For two inputs, it is true if the two inputs are different.
  - its symbol is equal to an OR, but with an extra curves line on the input side.
  - a XOR can be seen as an inverter.
