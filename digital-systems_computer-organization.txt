Binary Decoder: takes a binary number as input and sets one of several data output lines to 1 and the rest to 0.
  - a 2x4 binary decoder would take S0 and S1 as input and would activate one of the output signals D0 to D3.
  - it can be seen as a demultiplexer with input signal D=1.
Demultiplexer: routes a single input value to one of several output lines.
  - a four-output demultiplexer would have an input signal D, two selector signals S0 and S1, and four output signals D0 to D3.
Multiplexer: device that selects one of several data inputs to be routed to a single data output.
  - an eight-input multiplexer would have data input lines with inputs from D0 to D7, select control lines with signals S0 to S2 and a single data output line F.
